# RO/bot :shipit:
This is a UserScript file to automaticaly vote and log in to new room at [Reddit's Robin](https://www.reddit.com/robin/)

## Instalation
Simply use any Userscript Extension for your browser.

Some examples:

Opera - [Violent Monkey](https://addons.opera.com/cs/extensions/details/violent-monkey/) [Tested - working]

Chrome - [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)

Firefox - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/cs/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)

After you have your extension installed, just [click this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cerx-pw/ro-bot/master/RObot.js) and hit install, or copy&paste this code.

Refresh Robin page and it should work!

**This script operates seamlessly!**
To ensure RO/bot is working check developer console in your browser.
You should see there
```
Cerx's RO/bot initialized
...
```
If that's not your case...

###...Report bugs!
It's just a proof-of-concept at this stage, may not work that great.
Please, report any bugs or disfunctions **[here](https://github.com/Cerx-pw/ro-bot/issues)**!
Any ideas on how to improve this script are also much appreciated.
Thanks!

###Disclaimer
This is my first open-source project, be kind. :)
